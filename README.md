# Android_RockPaperScissors

THE BRIEF

Create a simple one page Android app to allow the user to play rock, paper, scissors.

They will enter their chosen move by clicking a button, the computer will randomly pick a move to play against them.

The player will see the both the computer's choice and the result of the game on the screen.

THE PROJECT

Employing what I've been learning in Java to revisit the Rock, Paper, Scissors game I first modelled in Ruby. 
Writing tests to ensure the integrity of the logic.
Putting into practice what I've been learning about Android Studio and XML.

I derived huge satisfaction from finally getting my head around game logic and modelling an albeit simple game.
Being able to show the game to friends and family was immensely rewarding.
